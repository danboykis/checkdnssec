This tiny throw-away utility queries a zone based on given parameters and 
verifies every queried RR set for a valid RRSIG.

Suppose I want to verify that nist.gov's SOA, A and MX records have proper RRSIG records.

java -jar checkdnssec-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar NS:ns1.nist.gov. nist.gov.:A nist.gov.:SOA nist.gov.:MX

Where NS stands for nameserver.

To build checkdnssec:
mvn assembly:assembly
