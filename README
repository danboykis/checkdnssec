This tiny throw-away utility queries a zone based on given parameters and 
verifies every queried RR set for a valid RRSIG.

Suppose I want to verify that nist.gov's SOA, A and MX records have proper RRSIG records.

java -jar checkdnssec-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -z nist.gov. --ns=ns1.nist.gov. -Dnist.gov.:A -Dnist.gov.:SOA -Dnist.gov.:MX

-z stands for zone name
--ns stands for nameserver.
-D precedes the name-type pair you want to verify

To build checkdnssec:
mvn assembly:assembly
